I am Fabian Bonilla and I work at the department of geotechnical engineering, earth sciences and natural hazards (GERS), 
at the University Gustave Eiffel. My research interests include:

1. linear and nonlinear site response analyses, 
2. wave propagation in complex media, 
3. monitoring temporal variations of soil properties during ground motion, 
4. simulation of ground motion, and 
5. probabilistic seismic hazard.
